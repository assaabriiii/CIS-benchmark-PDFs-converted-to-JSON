Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.\n\nThe DBMS must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.\n\nAutomation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
