A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.\n\nA comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.\n\nExamples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in noncentralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.\n\nThe DBMS must be configured to automatically use organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.\n\nAutomation may comprise differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",

To enable the use of SSL, the postgres 'ssl' configuration parameter must be set to 'on', and the database instance needs to be configured to use a valid server certificate and private key installed on the server. With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted. However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from nonlocal hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections. The hostssl connections can be further configured to require that the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection.",

By default, a database named 'edb' and a superuser named 'enterprisedb' are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).\n\nIn the postgresql.conf file, set the 'ssl' parameter as follows:\n\nssl = on\n\nEnsure the parameter is uncommented.\n\nIn order to start an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance in SSL mode, files containing the server certificate and private key must exist. By default, these files are expected to exist in the Postgres data directory and are expected to be named server.crt and server.key, respectively. Update the ssl_cert_file and ssl_cert_key parameters in the postgresql.conf file if the files are placed in a different location or are named differently. Note that changes to the SSL parameter setting and any of the other SSL-related parameters require a database server restart to be put the changes into effect.\n\nTo restart the database on a systemd server, issue the following command as the root user or a user with sudo access:\n\n> systemctl restart edb-as-Whereis the major version of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance (e.g., 15).\n\nTo restart the database on an initd server, issue the following command as the root user or a user with sudo access:\n\n> systemctl restart edb-as-Whereis the major version of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance (e.g., 15).\n\nAfter verifying SSL is enabled for the database, open the pg_hba.conf file in an editor to configure the host-based authentication settings.
