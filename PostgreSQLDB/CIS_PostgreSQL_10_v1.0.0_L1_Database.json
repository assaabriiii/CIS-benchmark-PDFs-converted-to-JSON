You should configure this as recommended by the pgBadger development team unless directed otherwise by your organization's logging policy. The default value is < %m >.\n    % characters begin 'escape sequences' that are replaced with status information as outlined below. Unrecognized escapes are ignored. Other characters are copied straight to the log line. Some escapes are only recognized by session processes and will be treated as empty by background processes such as the main server process. Status information may be aligned either left or right by specifying a numeric literal after the % and before the option. A negative value will cause the status information to be padded on the right with spaces to give it a minimum width, whereas a positive value will pad on the left. Padding can be useful to aid human readability in log files.\n      The default is < %m >, but any of the following escape sequences can be used:\n      Escape  Effect                                            Session only\n    %a      Application name                                  yes\n    %u      User name                                         yes\n    %d      Database name                                     yes\n    %r      Remote host name or IP address, and remote port   yes\n    %h      Remote host name or IP address                    yes\n    %p      Process ID                                        no\n    %t      Time stamp without milliseconds                   no\n    %m      Time stamp with milliseconds                      no\n    %i      Command tag: type of session's current command    yes\n    %e      SQLSTATE error code                               no\n    %c      Session ID: see below                             no\n    %l      Number of the log line for each session\n      or process, starting at 1                         no\n    %s      Process start time stamp                          no\n    %v      Virtual transaction ID (backendID/localXID)       no\n    %x      Transaction ID (0 if none is assigned)            no\n    %q      Produces no output, but tells non-session\n      processes to stop at this point in the string;\n      ignored by session processes                      no\n    %%      Literal %\n\n      Rationale:\n\n      Properly setting log_line_prefix allows for adding additional information to each log entry (such as the user, or the database).

        "info": "PostgreSQL must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of organization-defined information at rest (to include, at a minimum, PII and classified information) on organization-defined information system components.\n\n      Rationale:\n\n      PostgreSQL handling data that requires 'data at rest' protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to PostgreSQL or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system settings, as appropriate to the situation. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g. disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system.\n      Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e. full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g. files, records, or fields). Organizations may also optionally choose to implement both to implement layered security.\n      The decision whether, and what, to encrypt rests with the data owner and is also influenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and media on which the information resides. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate. If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.\n      The PostgreSQL pgcrypto extension provides cryptographic functions for PostgreSQL and is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of user and system information at rest in non-mobile devices.",
        "solution": "The pgcrypto extension is included with the PostgreSQL 'contrib' package. Although included, it needs to be created in the database.\n      As the database administrator, run the following:\n      postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;\n      CREATE EXTENSION\n      Verify pgcrypto is installed:\n      postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name='pgcrypto';\n      name   | default_version | installed_version |         comment\n      ----------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------\n      pgcrypto | 1.3             | 1.3               | cryptographic functions\n    (1 row)\n\n      Impact:\n\n      When considering or undertaking any form of encryption, it is critical to understand the state of the encrypted data at all stages of the data lifecycle. The use of pgcrypto ensures that the data at rest in the tables (and therefore on disk) is encrypted, but for the data to be accessed by any users or applications, said users/applications will, by necessity, have access to the encrypt and decrypt keys and the data in question will be encrypted/decrypted in memory and then transferred to/from the user/application in that form.",

        "solution": "Follow these steps to remediate the configuration:\n      * Determine permissions based on your organization's security policies.\n      * Relocate all files and ensure their permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only superuser read access.\n      * Ensure all directories where these files are located have restricted permissions such that the superuser can read but not write.\n      * Lastly, change the settings accordingly in the postgresql.conf configuration file and restart the database cluster for changes to take effect.\n\n      Default Value:\n\n      The dynamic_library_path default is $libdir and unix_socket_directories default is /var/run/postgresql, /tmp. The default for external_pid_file and all library parameters are initially null, or not set, upon cluster creation.",
