        "info": "ESXi hosts come with Secure Shell (SSH), which can be configured to authenticate remote\n      users using public key authentication. For day-to-day operations, the ESXi host should be in\n      lockdown mode with the SSH service disabled. Lockdown mode does not prevent root\n      users from logging in using keys. The presence of a remote user's public key in the\n      /etc/ssh/keys-root/authorized_keys file on an ESXi host identifies the user as trusted,\n      meaning the user is granted access to the host without providing a password.\n\n    Disabling authorized_keys access may limit your ability to run unattended remote scripts.\n\n    *Rationale*\n\n    Keeping the authorized_keys file empty prevents users from circumventing the intended\n    restrictions of lockdown mode.",
