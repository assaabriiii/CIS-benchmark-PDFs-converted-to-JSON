As virtual memory usage exceeds RAM, the host relies more on swap space. If enabled, memory ballooning lets virtual machines give up the unused portion of that memory. The freed memory can be reused by other processes and virtual machines on the host. The reduced memory footprint makes swapping less likely and improves performance.",
