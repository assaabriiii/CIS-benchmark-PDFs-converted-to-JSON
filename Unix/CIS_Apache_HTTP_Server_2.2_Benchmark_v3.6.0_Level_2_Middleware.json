The TLSv1.0 protocol is vulnerable to information disclosure and both protocols lack support for modern cryptographic algorithms including authenticated encryption. The only SSL/TLS protocols that should be allowed is TLSv1.2 along with the new TLSv1.3 protocol when it is supported.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe TLSv1.0 protocol is vulnerable to the BEAST attack when used in CBC mode (October 2011). Unfortunately, the TLSv1.0 uses CBC modes for all of the block mode ciphers, which only leaves the RC4 streaming cipher which is also weak and is not recommended. Therefore, it is recommended that the TLSv1.0 protocol be disabled. The TLSv1.1 protocol does not support Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) which is designed to simultaneously provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. All major up-to-date browsers support TLSv1.2, and most recent versions of FireFox and Chrome support the newer TLSv1.3 protocol, since 2017.\n\nThe NIST SP 800-52r2 guidelines for TLS configuration require that TLS 1.2 is configured with FIPS-based cipher suites be supported by all government TLS servers and clients and requires support of TLS 1.3 by January 1, 2024.

Protocols such as RSA do not provide the forward secrecy, while the protocols 'ECDHE' (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) and the 'DHE' (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) will provide forward secrecy. The 'ECDHE' is the stronger protocol and should be preferred, while the 'DHE' may be allowed for greater compatibility with older clients. The TLS ciphers should be configured to require either the 'ECDHE' or the 'DHE' ephemeral key exchange, while not allowing other cipher suites.\n\nRationale:\n\nDuring the TLS handshake, after the initial client & server Hello, there is a pre-master secret generated, which is used to generate the master secret, and in turn generates the session key. When using protocols that do not provide forward secrecy, such as RSA, the pre-master secret is encrypted by the client with the server's public key and sent over the network. However, with protocols such as 'ECDHE' (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) the pre-master secret is not sent over the wire, even in encrypted format. The key exchange arrives at the shared secret in the clear using ephemeral keys that are not stored or used again. With FS, each session has a unique key exchange, so that future sessions are protected.",

        "info": "SELinux includes customizable targeted policies that may be used to confine the Apache httpd server to enforce least privileges so the httpd server has only the minimal access to specified directories, files, and network ports. Access is controlled by process types (domains) defined for the httpd process. There are over a hundred individual httpd related types defined in a default Apache SELinux policy, which includes many of the common Apache add-ons and applications such as php, nagios, and smokeping. The default SELinux policies work well for a default Apache installation, but implementation of SELinux targeted policies on a complex or highly customized web server requires a rather significant development and testing effort which comprehends both the workings of SELinux and the detailed operations and requirements of the web application.\n\nAll directories and files to be accessed by the web server process must have security labels with appropriate types. The following types are a sample of the most commonly used:\n- 'http_port_t' - Network ports allowed for listening\n- 'httpd_sys_content_t' - Read access to directories and files with web content\n- 'httpd_log_t' - Directories and files to be used for writable log data\n- 'httpd_sys_script_exec_t' - Directories and files for executable content.\n\nRationale:\n\nWith the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the web application may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by SELinux because the inappropriate files are not labeled as 'httpd_sys_content_t'. Likewise, writing to an unexpected directory or execution of unexpected content can be prevented by similar mandatory security labels enforced by SELinux.",
        "solution": "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:\n\nIf the running httpd processes are not confined to the 'httpd_t' SELinux context, check the context for the httpd binary and the 'apachectl' binary, and set the httpd binary to have a context of 'httpd_exec_t' and the 'apachectl' executable to have a context of 'initrc_exec_t', as shown below. Also note that on some platforms, such as Ubuntu, the Apache executable is named apache2 instead of httpd.\n\n# ls -alZ /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.* /usr/sbin/apachectl\n-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/apachectl\n-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd\n-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd.worker\n-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd.event\n\nIf the executable files are not labeled correctly, they may be relabeled with the 'chcon' command, as shown; however, the file system labeling is based on the SELinux file context policies, and the file systems will on some occasions be relabeled according to the policy.\n\n# chcon -t initrc_exec_t /usr/sbin/apachectl\n# chcon -t httpd_exec_t /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.*\n\nSince the file system may be relabeled based on SELinux policy, it's best to check the SELinux policy with the 'semanage fcontext -l' option. If the policy is not present, add the pattern to the policy using the '-a' option. The 'restorecon' command shown below will restore the file context label according to the current policy, and is required if a pattern was added.\n\n# ### Check the Policy\n# semanage fcontext -l | fgrep 'apachectl'\n# /usr/sbin/apachectl regular file system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t:s0\n# semanage fcontext -l | fgrep '/usr/sbin/httpd'\n# /usr/sbin/httpd regular file system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0\n# /usr/sbin/httpd.worker regular file system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0\n# /usr/sbin/httpd.event regular file system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0\n# ### Add to the policy, if not present\n# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t httpd_exec_t '/usr/sbin/httpd'\n# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t httpd_exec_t '/usr/sbin/httpd.worker'\n# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t httpd_exec_t '/usr/sbin/httpd.event'\n# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t initrc_exec_t /usr/sbin/apachectl\n\n# ### Restore the file labeling accord to the SELinux policy\n# restorecon -v /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.* /usr/sbin/apachectl",
