        "info": "The chroot() system call causes an application to run with limited file system access so that a subdirectory becomes the root directory for the application environment. When this is done, the application is 'jailed' and no longer has access to the entire file structure but is limited to the given subdirectory.\n\nThe chroot'd subdirectory and the recommendations in section 'Enable SELinux to Restrict BIND Processes' provide similar controls, in that the DNS service is prevented from accessing and modifying inappropriate files. SELinux goes well beyond what the chroot is able to prevent, however for audit purposes either control, the chroot'd subdirectory or the SELinux in enforcing mode is sufficient.\n\nRationale:\n\nAlthough there are ways that a chroot jail can be broken, most methods require that a process be running as root in order to escape. Since BIND should be run as a different user than root, a chroot is an effective defense, to limit access to sensitive system configuration files. In the event that BIND has a vulnerability that allows code execution, the attack will not have access to the real system files such as /etc/password, but will be limited to the files placed in the chroot subdirectory.",
        "solution": "Perform the following:\n\nStop the named service and install the bind-chroot package to provide the chroot directories.\n\n# systemctl stop named.service\n# yum install bind-chroot\n\nEdit the /etc/sysconfig/named configuration file to have a line similar to the one shown below that sets the ROOTDIR environment variable.\n\nROOTDIR='/var/named/chroot'\n\nMove all the configuration files and any master zone files into their respective directions under the subdirectory /var/named/chroot/\n\nIt may be helpful to create symbolic links from a couple of system /etc files such as /etc/named.conf and /etc/rndc.key to the real files in the chroot'ed subdirectory, so that utilities like rndc will work as expected. Do not create symbolic links or hard links from inside the chroot to external resources! Instead use symbolic links to point from the outside resources into the chroot.\n\nRestart the named service and test the configuration.\n\n# systemctl start named.service\n\nDefault Value:\n\nThe BIND service is not chroot'ed by default.",

        "description": "10.2 Ensure BIND Processes Run in the named_t Confined Context Type",
        "info": "SELinux includes customizable targeted policies that may be used to confine the BIND named server to enforce least privileges so that the server has only the minimal access to specified directories, files and network ports. Access is controlled by process types (domains) defined for the named process. There are about a dozen related types defined in a default named SELinux policy. The default SELinux policies work well for a default BIND installation, however testing of the SELinux polices with the specific BIND operations is highly recommended. All directories and files to be accessed by the named server process must have security labels with appropriate types. The following file context types are a sample of the most commonly used:\n\nnamed_cache_t - Directories and files with dynamically updated contents\n\nnamed_conf_t - Directories and Configuration files to be read, but not updated\n\nnamed_exec_t - BIND related Executables\n\nThe seinfo may be used list the types that are configured. For example, the following will list the relevant types that begin with named_\n\n# seinfo -t | grep ' named_'\n\nThe semanage fcontext command may be used to list file context mapping. For example:\n\n# semanage fcontext -l | grep ':named_'\n\nRationale:\n\nWith the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the BIND named server may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by SELinux because the inappropriate files are not labeled with necessary named specific context. Likewise writing to an unexpected directory or execution of unexpected content can be prevented by similar mandatory security labels enforced by SELinux.",
        "solution": "If the running named process is not confined to the named_t SELinux context. Then check the labeled context for the named binaries and set the binary files to have a context of named_exec_t as shown below. The named-checkconf executable should have named_checkconf_exec_t type.\n\n# ls -Z  /usr/sbin/named /usr/sbin/named-checkconf /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor\n          system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/named\nsystem_u:object_r:named_checkconf_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/named-checkconf\n          system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor\n\nIf the executable files are not labeled correctly, they may be relabeled with the chcon command, as shown, however the file system labeling is based on the SELinux file context mapping polices and the file systems will on some occasions be relabeled according to the policy.\n\n# chcon -t named_exec_t /usr/sbin/named /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor\n# chcon -t named_checkconf_exec_t /usr/sbin/named-checkconf\n\nSince the file system may be relabeled based on SELinux policy, it's best to check the SELinux policy with semanage fcontext -l option. If the policy is not present, then add the pattern to the policy using the --add option. The restorecon command shown below will restore the file context label according to the current policy, which is required if a pattern was added.\n\n# ### Check the Policy\n# semanage fcontext -l | grep '/usr/sbin/named*'\n/usr/sbin/named            regular file system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0\n/usr/sbin/named-checkconf  regular file system_u:object_r:named_checkconf_exec_t:\ns0\n\n# semanage fcontext -l | grep /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor\n/usr/sbin/unbound-anchor   regular file system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0\n\n# ### Add to the policy, if not present\n# semanage fcontext --add -f f -t named_exec_t /usr/sbin/named\n# semanage fcontext --add -f f -t named_exec_t /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor\n# semanage fcontext --add -f f -t named_checkconf_exec_t /usr/sbin/named-checkconf\n\n# ### Restore the file labeling accord to the SELinux policy\n# restorecon -v /usr/sbin/named /usr/sbin/named-checkconf /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor\n\nRestarting the BIND named service will also be required.\n\nDefault Value:\n\nThe name_t is the default type for ISC BIND named if SELinux is enabled.",
