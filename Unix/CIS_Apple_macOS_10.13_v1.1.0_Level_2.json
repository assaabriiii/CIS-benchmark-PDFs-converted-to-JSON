This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.\n\nContent types supported by content caching in macOS\n\nRationale:\n\nThe main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk they add to the management complexity, since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary.\n\nImpact:\n\nThis setting will adversely affect bandwidth usage between local subnets and the Internet.",

DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled.\n\nRationale:\n\nBonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of 'I'm here!' messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery.

The system software itself uses keychains for secure storage. Anyone with physical access to an unlocked keychain where the screen is also unlocked can copy all passwords in that keychain. The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to lock when when the computer sleeps to reduce the risk of password exposure. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organization using keychain aware applications extensively.\n\nRationale:\n\nWhile logged in, the keychain does not prompt the user for passwords for various systems and/or programs. This can be exploited by unauthorized users to gain access to password protected programs and/or systems in the absence of the user.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe user may experience multiple prompts to unlock the keychain when waking from sleep.",
