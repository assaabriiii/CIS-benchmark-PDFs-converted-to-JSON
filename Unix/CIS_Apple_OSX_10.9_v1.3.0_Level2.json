If you set Apple Mail to check for email every 10 minutes using the keychain for credentials and the keychain to lock every 15 minutes if inactive it will still cause the keychain to lock. The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to periodically lock when inactive to reduce the risk of password exposure or unauthorized use of credentials by a third party. The time period that an organization uses will depend on how great the use is of keychain aware applications. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organization using keychain aware applications extensively.  While logged in, the keychain does not prompt the user for passwords for various systems and/or programs.
