        "info": "Separate management plane traffic from data plane traffic.\nRationale:\nSeparating the management plane traffic from data plane traffic ensures that these traffics are on their respective paths. These paths could then be individually monitored and could be tied to different traffic control policies and monitoring. It also ensures that management plane is always reachable despite the huge volume of data flow.\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
