While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.\n\nmacOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.\n\n\n\n\nImpact:\n\nThe SSH server built-in to macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications including email, web browser and productivity tools should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH, if they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.\n\nFor macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:\n\nDo not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks, this is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.\n\nDo not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.\n\nDetailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark",

If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a time machine backup.

Filesystem formatting and manipulation is only available in the command line and not the GUI and there are some reported gaps with the encryption capabilities. Until the filesystem supports boot volumes, FileVault, OS integrated encryption and key management as well as GUI management it should not be used with production systems.\n\nAPFS is part of macOS 10.13 and is expected to be used there.

Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.\n\nIn many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.\n\nEven with all of these positives some environments may wish to disable AirDrop. Organizations where Bluetooth and Wireless are not used will disable AirDrop by blocking it's necessary interfaces. Organizations that have disabled USB and other pluggable storage mechanisms and have blocked all unmanaged cloud and transfer solutions for DLP may want to disable AirDrop as well.\n\nAirDrop should be used with Contacts only to limit attacks.\n\nMore info:\n\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-apple-keeps-your-airdrop-files-private-and-secure\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
