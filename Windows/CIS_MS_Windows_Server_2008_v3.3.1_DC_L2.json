Because the task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise environments. However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain-based Group Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the IIS_WPG group and the IUSR_(ComputerName), ASPNET, and IWAM_(ComputerName) accounts. If this user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality.",

IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)\n\nRationale:\n\nSince the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.\n\nImpact:\n\nConnectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.\n\nThis registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.\n\nNote: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.",

Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not 'undo' the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.\n\nDefault Value:\n\nAll IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4.",
