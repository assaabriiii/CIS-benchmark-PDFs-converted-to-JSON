        "info": "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)\n\nRationale:\nSince the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.",
        "solution": "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD):\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TCPIP6\\Parameters:DisabledComponents\nNote: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.\nNote #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not 'undo' the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.\n\nImpact:\nConnectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.\nThis registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.\nNote: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.\n\nDefault Value:\nAll IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4.",

The USB Type-C (USB-C) port standard that is now common in many computers, especially laptops, utilizes Thunderbolt technology, and therefore may be affected by this restriction. If your organization needs to use USB-C extensively, you may need to decide, internally, to allow yourselves an exception to this recommendation. However, please ensure that all necessary decision-makers have accepted the increased risk of BitLocker encryption key theft (and therefore data theft) via malicious Thunderbolt devices (when left unattended), by doing so.\n\nNote #2: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (and newer), there is a new control named Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those systems.\n\nRationale:\nA BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.\nBitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.\nThis issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445: Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker.",

Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.\nSecure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.\nWhen this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the 'Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile' group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.\nNote: If the group policy setting 'Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations' is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.\n\nRationale:\nSecure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and other types of malware from gaining control of the system.

        "info": "This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on removable data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.\nYou can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.\nNote: The 'Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength' policy setting does not apply to hardware-based encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardware-based encryption is set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The 'Restrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed for hardware-based encryption' option enables you to restrict the encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable the use of hardware-based encryption.\nEncryption algorithms are specified by object identifiers (OID). For example:\n- AES 128 in CBC mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2\n- AES 256 in CBC mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2;2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42.\n\nRationale:\nFrom a strict security perspective the hardware-based encryption may offer the same, greater, or less protection than what is provided by BitLocker's software-based encryption depending on how the algorithms and key lengths compare.",
