        "info": "Note: Internal domain connections from a PAW to communicate with IT resources being managed via the PAW with domain controllers or with a digital credential verification service (for example, Online Certificate Status Protocol [OCSP]) are allowed.\n\nA main security architectural construct of a PAW is that the workstation is isolated from most internet threats, including phishing, impersonation, and credential theft attacks. This isolation is partially implemented by blocking all outbound connections to the internet.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
        "solution": "Configure the PAW host-based firewall to block outbound connection requests to the internet gateway or configure the PAW with an internet proxy address with a loopback address. Allowed exceptions include connections to communicate with IT resources being managed via the PAW, including the management console of authorized public cloud services, with domain controllers, or with a digital credential verification service (for example, OCSP).\n\nIf the PAW host-based firewall method is used, configure the firewall to block outbound connection requests to the internet gateway. The exact configuration procedure will depend on which host-based firewall (for example, Endpoint Security Solution [ESS]) is used on the PAW. DoD sites should refer to DoD policies and firewall STIGs to determine acceptable firewalls products.\n\nIf the internet proxy address with a loopback address method is used, consider using the configuration instructions listed in the Microsoft Privileged Access Workstation paper.\n\nIn addition, disable the capability of the administrator to manually override the proxy settings on each PAW.",
