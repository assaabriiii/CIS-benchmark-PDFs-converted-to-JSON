When the server finds an .htaccess file (as specified by AccessFileName) it needs to know which directives declared in that file can override earlier access information. When this directive is set to None, then .htaccess files are completely ignored. In this case, the server will not even attempt to read .htaccess files in the file system. When this directive is set to All, then any directive which has the .htaccess Context is allowed in .htaccess files.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",

For example, methods such as PUT and DELETE are rarely used and should be disabled in keeping with the primary security principal of minimize features and options. Also since the usage of these methods is typically to modify resources on the web server, they should be explicitly disallowed. For normal web server operation, you will typically need to allow only the GET, HEAD and POST request methods. This will allow for downloading of web pages and submitting information to web forms. The OPTIONS request method will also be allowed as it is used to request which HTTP request methods are allowed.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
