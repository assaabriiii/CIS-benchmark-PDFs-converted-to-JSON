The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-alone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).\n\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.\n\nIf you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess.

Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords.

You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next day.",

There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'passphrase' is a better term than 'password.' In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).\n\nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.\n\nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.\n\nImpact:\n\nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.\n\nNote: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters.

This fifth category can be regionally specific.\n\nEach additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords.

However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.\n\nIf your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.\n\nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range.

If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting.\n\nIf you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).\n\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.\n\nRationale:\n\nUsers can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is too long, a DoS attack could occur. An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to each user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you notify users of the values used for this policy setting so that they will wait for the lockout timer to expire before they call the help desk about their inability to log on.",

For example, the Access this computer from the network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will be able to read the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf you remove the Access this computer from the network user right on Domain Controllers for all users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network resources. If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to connect to those servers through the network.

For this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default Domain Controller Policy for the domain.

Users who have been assigned the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether or not they have been assigned the Add workstations to domain user right.\n\nIn Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install Windows on his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the password for the local Administrator account, and could log on with that account and then add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.\n\nImpact:\n\nFor organizations that have never allowed users to set up their own computers and add them to the domain, this countermeasure will have no impact. For those that have allowed some or all users to configure their own computers, this countermeasure will force the organization to establish a formal process for these procedures going forward.

Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.\n\nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:\n\nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.\n\nAll Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.\n\nAll PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.\n\nThe PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.\n\nThis vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.\n\nImpact:\n\nThere should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.",

The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell.

        "info": "This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Require signing.\n\nNote: Domain member computers must have Network security: LDAP signing requirements (Rule 2.3.11.8) set to Negotiate signing or higher. If not, they will fail to authenticate once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain Controllers. Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration.\n\nNote #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller.\n\nNote #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients (including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to identify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article: Identifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC's - Practical Windows Security\n\nRationale:\n\nUnsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.\n\nAdditionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account passwords by other systems on the network.\n\nImpact:\n\nUnless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. Clients that do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the Domain Controllers. All Windows 2000-based computers in your organization that are managed from Windows Server 2003-based or Windows XP-based computers and that use Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication must have Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed. Alternatively, these clients must have a registry change. For information about this registry change, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 325465: Windows 2000 domain controllers require SP3 or later when using Windows Server 2003 administration tools. Also, some non-Microsoft operating systems do not support LDAP signing. If you enable this policy setting, client computers that use those operating systems may be unable to access domain resources.",

Configuring this setting to Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to the benchmark.\n\nRationale:\n\nUsers sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session.\n\nIf you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is removed.\n\nIf you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function identically to Lock Workstation.\n\nEnforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time.

For more information about these settings, see the 'Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related settings)' section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.\n\nRationale:\n\nSession hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress.

        "description": "2.3.11.7 Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'",
        "info": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:\n\nJoin a domain\n\nAuthenticate between Active Directory forests\n\nAuthenticate to down-level domains\n\nAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP\n\nAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domain\n\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM.\n\nRationale:\n\nWindows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.\n\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.\n\nImpact:\n\nClients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.",

For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.\n\nImpact:\n\nNone - this is the default behavior. However, if you choose instead to configure the server to require LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client.

Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.\n\n4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.\n\n4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.\n\n4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.\n\n4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.\n\n5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.\n\n5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully.

        "info": "This setting determines whether the LDAP server (Domain Controller) enforces validation of Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) received in LDAP bind requests that are sent over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS).\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended).\n\nNote: All LDAP clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to be compatible with Domain Controllers that have this setting enabled. More information on this setting is available at: MSKB 4034879: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to make LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure\n\nNote #2: In March 2020, Microsoft added a new GPO setting named Domain controller: LDAP server channel binding token requirements which was bundled with that month's Windows security patches. This new 'native' setting configures the exact same LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry value and does not depend on an ADMX template. Therefore it should be considered a 'superseding' method of achieving the same results. However, since Extended Support ended on January 14, 2020 for Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) and Windows Server 2008 R2, and they are no longer receiving security patches (unless hosted on Azure or under a paid support contract), they typically do not have the March 2020 (or later) patch readily available. If this is the case in your environment, this ADMX-based setting should be used with those OSes instead of the new native setting.\n\nRationale:\n\nRequiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to capture users' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) from reusing those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase protection against 'man-in-the-middle' attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS (LDAPS).\n\nImpact:\n\nAll LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). The LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that do not do so. Clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to support this feature, and may have compatibility issues with this setting without the security update. This may also mean that LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may stop working until the security update is installed.\n\nWhen first deploying this setting, you may initially want to only set it to the alternate setting of Enabled: Enabled, when supported (instead of Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended)) on all Domain Controllers. This alternate, interim setting enables support for LDAP client channel binding but does not require it. Then set one DC that is not currently being targeted by LDAP clients to Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended), and test each of the critical LDAP clients against that DC (and remediating as necessary), before deploying Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended) to the rest of the DCs.\n\nMore information on this setting is available at: MSKB 4034879: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to make LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure\n\nOlder OSes such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), will first require patches for Microsoft Security Advisory 973811, as well as all associated fixes, in order to be compatible with domain controllers that have this setting deployed.\n\nNote: Only Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended) is actually considered compliant to the CIS benchmark.",

Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.\n\nRationale:\n\nUsers with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.\n\nImpact:\n\nNone - this is the default behavior.",
        "solution": "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:\n\nUser Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Installer\\Always install with elevated privileges\n\nNote: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.\n\nDefault Value:\n\nDisabled. (Windows Installer will apply the current user's permissions when it installs programs that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. This will prevent standard users from installing applications that affect system-wide configuration items.)",
