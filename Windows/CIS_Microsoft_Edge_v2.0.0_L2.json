The WebHID API allows websites to access alternative auxiliary keyboards and exotic gamepads.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not allow any site to request access to HID devices via the WebHID API.\n\nRationale:\n\nDisabling the WebHID API prevents HID peripherals from exposing powerful functionality that should not be made accessible to the page without explicit consent. For instance, a HID peripheral may have sensors that allow it to collect information about its surroundings; a device may store private information that should not be revealed or overwritten. Operating systems typically do not restrict access to HID devices from applications, and this access can occasionally be abused to damage the device or corrupt the data stored on it.\n\nImpact:\n\nWebHID describes a wide array of devices that could be supported through HID, including virtual reality controls, flight simulators, medical equipment, and more. Disabling WebHID would require additional drivers or modification to enable support for approved devices.",

        "info": "This policy setting controls extension management settings for Microsoft Edge, including any controlled by existing extension-related policies. This policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.\n\nNOTE: This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID '*', which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest. If the override_update_url flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the update URL specified in the ExtensionInstallForcelist (Control which extensions are installed silently) policy or in update_url field in this policy. The flag override_update_url is ignored if the update_url is the Edge Add-ons website update URL.\n\nNote #2: For more granular control the ExtensionInstallForcelist and ExtensionInstallAllowlist (Allow specific extensions to be installed) to allow or force install of specific extensions even if the store is blocked using the JSON in the example. {'update_url:https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx':{'installation_mode':'blocked'}}\n\nFor more details, check out the detailed guide to _ExtensionSettings_ policy available from Microsoft at Detailed guide to the ExtensionSettings policy | Microsoft Learn\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: *.\n\nRationale:\n\nBlocking extensions that could potentially allow remote control of the system through the browser is a good security practice. If extensions are needed for securing the browser, or for enterprise use, these can be enabled by configuring the setting Allow specific extensions to be installed.\n\nImpact:\n\nAny installed extension will be removed unless it is specified on the extension allowlist, if an organization is using any approved password managers ensure that the extension is added to the allowlist.",
