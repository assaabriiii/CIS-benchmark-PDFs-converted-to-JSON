Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length.

At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack.

A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.\n\nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range.

Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s)\n\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.\n\nUsers can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.",

If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.\n - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.\n - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.\n - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.\n - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets.

        "info": "This policy setting specifies a set of parameters for controlling the Windows NTP Client.\n\nThe recommended STIG state for this setting is Enabled: NT5DS\n\nNote: Domain-joined systems use NT5DS to synchronize time from other systems in the domain by default.\n\nThe following settings are available to configure:\n\nNtpServer : The Domain Name System (DNS) name or IP address of an NTP time source. This value is in the form of dnsName,flags where flags is a hexadecimal bitmask of the flags for that host. For more information, see the NTP Client Group Policy Settings Associated with Windows Time section of the Windows Time Service Group Policy Settings. The default value is time.windows.com,0x09\n\nType : This value controls the authentication that W32time uses. The default value is NT5DS.\n\nCrossSiteSyncFlags : This value, expressed as a bitmask, controls how W32time chooses time sources outside its own site. The possible values are 0, 1, and 2. Setting this value to 0 (None) indicates that the time client should not attempt to synchronize time outside its site. Setting this value to 1 (PdcOnly) indicates that only the computers that function as primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations masters in other domains can be used as synchronization partners when the client has to synchronize time with a partner outside its own site. Setting a value of 2 (All) indicates that any synchronization partner can be used. This value is ignored if the NT5DS value is not set. The default value is 2 decimal (0x02 hexadecimal).\n\nResolvePeerBackoffMinutes : This value, expressed in minutes, controls how long W32time waits before it attempts to resolve a DNS name when a previous attempt failed. The default value is 15 minutes.\n\nResolvePeerBackoffMaxTimes : This value controls how many times W32time attempts to resolve a DNS name before the discovery process is restarted. Each time DNS name resolution fails, the amount of time to wait before the next attempt will be twice the previous amount. The default value is seven attempts.\n\nSpecialPollInterval : This NTP client value, expressed in seconds, controls how often a manually configured time source is polled when the time source is configured to use a special polling interval. If the SpecialInterval flag is enabled on the\n\nNTPServer\n\nsetting, the client uses the value that is set as the SpecialPollInterval instead of a variable interval between MinPollInterval and MaxPollInterval values, to determine how frequently to poll the time source. SpecialPollInterval must be in the range of [ MinPollInterval MaxPollInterval ], else the nearest value of the range is picked. Default: 1024 seconds.\n\nEventLogFlags : This value is a bitmask that controls events that may be logged to the System log in Event Viewer. Setting this value to 0x1 indicates that W32time will create an event whenever a time jump is detected. Setting this value to 0x2 indicates that W32time will create an event whenever a time source change is made. Because it is a bitmask value, setting 0x3 (the addition of 0x1 and 0x2) indicates that both time jumps and time source changes will be logged.\n\nTime synchronization is essential for authentication and auditing purposes.",

        "description": "2.3.11.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'",
        "info": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:\n\n - Join a domain\n - Authenticate between Active Directory forests\n - Authenticate to down-level domains\n - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP\n - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain\n\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM\n\nWindows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.\n\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.",

Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration.\n\nNote #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind ( ldap_simple_bind ) or LDAP simple bind through SSL ( ldap_simple_bind_s ). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller.\n\nNote #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients (including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to identify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article:\n\nIdentifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC's - Practical Windows Security\n\nUnsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.\n\nAdditionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account passwords by other systems on the network.",

Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.",
