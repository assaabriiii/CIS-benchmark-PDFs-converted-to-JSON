        "description": "ActiveX Control Initialization",
        "info": "This policy setting specifies the Microsoft ActiveX initialization security level for all Microsoft Office applications. ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe For Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future.  \\n   \\n  If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows:  \\n   \\n  1 - Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user.  \\n   \\n  2 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, load in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or use the default (first-time initialization) settings. This level is similar to the default configuration, but does not prompt the user.  \\n   \\n  3 - If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings.  \\n   \\n  4 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings.  \\n   \\n  5 - If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values.   \\n   \\n  6 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values.  \\n   \\n  If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, if a control is marked SFI, the application loads the control in safe mode and uses persisted values (if any). If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings. In both situations, the Message Bar informs users that the controls have been disabled and prompts them to respond.  \\n   \\n  Important - Some ActiveX controls do not respect the safe mode registry setting, and therefore might load persisted data even though you configure this setting to instruct the control to use safe mode. This setting only increases security for ActiveX controls that are accurately marked as SFI. In situations that involve malicious or poorly designed code, an ActiveX control might be inaccurately marked as SFI.",

        "info": "This policy setting allows you to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be initialized based upon whether they are Safe For Initialization (SFI) or Unsafefor Initialization (UFI).  \\n   \\n  ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer--or it's possible the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date.\n\nSFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety wasn't important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode.  \\n   \\n  If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for loading controls in UserForms:  \\n   \\n  1- For a UFI or SFI signed control that supports safe and unsafe mode, load the control in unsafe mode. For an SFI signed control that only supports a safe mode configuration, load the control in safe mode. This option enforces the default configuration.  \\n   \\n  2 - Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI:  \\n   \\n  - For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using the default properties.  \\n   \\n  - For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration in the Microsoft Office 2016 release.  \\n   \\n  3 - Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI:  \\n   \\n  - For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control with its default properties.  \\n   \\n  - For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode.  \\n   \\n  4 - For a UFI signed control, load with the default properties of the control. For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode (considered to be the safest mode).  \\n   \\n  If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is as if you enable this policy setting and then select option 1.",

Multiple Office apps support VBA macros, but XLM macros are only supported by Excel. \\n If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options to determine how the specified applications will warn the user about VBA macros. There is also a check box that determines how Excel will warn the user about XLM macros. \\n For VBA macros, these are your choices: \\n - Disable VBA macros without notification: The application disables VBA macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. \\n - Disable VBA macros with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for VBA macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. \\n - Disable VBA macros except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. \\n - Enable VBA macros (not recommended): VBA macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. \\n If you disable or dont configure this policy setting, 'Disable VBA macros with notification' will be the default setting, and 'Enable Excel 4.0 macros when VBA macros are enabled' will be checked. When users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA or XLM macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking 'Enable Content' on the Trust Bar. \\n The following section only applies to Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros: \\n If you select the 'Enable Excel 4.0 macros when VBA macros are enabled' check box, the setting selected for VBA macros will also apply to XLM macros. If this check box is not selected, all XLM macros are disabled and users are not notified. \\n XLM macros cannot be signed and will be disabled if 'Disable VBA macros except digitally signed macros' is chosen. \\n If you have enabled the 'Prevent Excel from running XLM macros' policy setting, XLM macros cannot be run in Excel regardless of how you have configured this policy setting. \\n The following section only applies to VBA macros: \\n If you select the 'Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher' check box, users opening files with digitally signed macros but not by a Trusted Publisher will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. \\n And there are two additional check boxes that we recommend that you select to help improve security. \\n - Block certificates from trusted publishers that are installed in the current user certificate store \\n - Require Extended Key Usage (EKU) for certificates from trusted publishers \\n Note: These two check boxes only apply if you have selected the 'Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher' check box. \\n Note: The three check boxes about trusted publishers only apply to Version 2012 and later of Office and Visio. The 'Enable Excel 4.0 macros when VBA macros are enabled' check box only applies to Version 2111 and later of Office. None of the check boxes apply to Office 2016 or Office 2019. \\n If you select the 'Block certificates from trusted publishers that are installed in the local machine certificate store' check box, macros wont run if the certificate from the trusted publisher is installed in the current user certificate store. The certificate must be installed in the local machine certificate store for the macro to run. Only accounts with administrator access to the computer can install a certificate in the local machine certificate store. \\n If you select the 'Require Extended Key Usage (EKU) for certificates from trusted publishers' check box, the EKU must include 'Code Signing' as one of the uses of the certificate. \\n Important: If 'Disable all except digitally signed macros' is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases.  \\n Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. \\n Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized.

Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. \\n - Enable VBA macros (not recommended): VBA macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. \\n If you disable or dont configure this policy setting, 'Disable VBA macros with notification' will be the default setting, and 'Enable Excel 4.0 macros when VBA macros are enabled' will be checked. When users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA or XLM macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking 'Enable Content' on the Trust Bar. \\n The following section only applies to Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros: \\n If you select the 'Enable Excel 4.0 macros when VBA macros are enabled' check box, the setting selected for VBA macros will also apply to XLM macros. If this check box is not selected, all XLM macros are disabled and users are not notified. \\n XLM macros cannot be signed and will be disabled if 'Disable VBA macros except digitally signed macros' is chosen. \\n If you have enabled the 'Prevent Excel from running XLM macros' policy setting, XLM macros cannot be run in Excel regardless of how you have configured this policy setting. \\n The following section only applies to VBA macros: \\n If you select the 'Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher' check box, users opening files with digitally signed macros but not by a Trusted Publisher will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. \\n And there are two additional check boxes that we recommend that you select to help improve security. \\n - Block certificates from trusted publishers that are installed in the current user certificate store \\n - Require Extended Key Usage (EKU) for certificates from trusted publishers \\n Note: These two check boxes only apply if you have selected the 'Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher' check box. \\n Note: The three check boxes about trusted publishers only apply to Version 2012 and later of Office and Visio. The 'Enable Excel 4.0 macros when VBA macros are enabled' check box only applies to Version 2111 and later of Office. None of the check boxes apply to Office 2016 or Office 2019. \\n If you select the 'Block certificates from trusted publishers that are installed in the local machine certificate store' check box, macros wont run if the certificate from the trusted publisher is installed in the current user certificate store. The certificate must be installed in the local machine certificate store for the macro to run. Only accounts with administrator access to the computer can install a certificate in the local machine certificate store. \\n If you select the 'Require Extended Key Usage (EKU) for certificates from trusted publishers' check box, the EKU must include 'Code Signing' as one of the uses of the certificate. \\n Important: If 'Disable all except digitally signed macros' is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases.  \\n Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. \\n Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized.

This option corresponds to the 'Notifications for all macros' option in the 'Macro Settings' section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled.  \\n - Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the 'Disable all macros without notification' option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users.  \\n - Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the 'Notifications for digitally signed macros, all other macros disabled' option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows:  \\n --If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher.  \\n --If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future.  \\n --If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location.  \\n This option is the default configuration in Outlook.  \\n - No security check. This option corresponds to the 'Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)' option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended.  \\n If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled -- Warning for signed, disable unsigned.",

This option enforces the default configuration in Office. \\n   \\n - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. \\n   \\n - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. \\n   \\n - Enable all macros (not recommended):  All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. \\n   \\n If you disable this policy setting, 'Disable all with notification' will be the default setting. \\n   \\n If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking 'Enable Content' on the Trust Bar.  If the user clicks 'Enable Content', then the document is added as a trusted document. \\n   \\n If you select 'Disable all except digitally signed macros' we recommend that you also select the 'Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher' check box to help improve security. \\n If you select the 'Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher' check box, users opening files with digitally signed macros but not by a Trusted Publisher will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running.
