This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.\n\nIf you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing or updating device drivers whose device setup class GUIDs appear in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.\n\nIf you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: True (checked)\n\nA BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.\n\nBitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.\n\nThis issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:\n\nBlocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker\n\n.",
