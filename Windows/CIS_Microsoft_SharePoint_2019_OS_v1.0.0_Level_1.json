        "info": "Claims-based authentication enables systems and applications to authenticate a user\nwithout requiring the user to disclose more personal information than necessary.\nSharePoint continues to offer support for both claims and classic authentication modes.\nClaims-based identity is an identity model in SharePoint that includes features such as\nauthentication across users of Windows-based systems and systems that are not Windows-\nbased, multiple authentication types, stronger real-time authentication, a wider set of\nprincipal types, and delegation of user identity between applications.\n\nWhen a user signs in to SharePoint, the user's token is validated and then used to sign in to\nSharePoint. The user's token is a security token issued by a claims provider. When you\nbuild claims-aware applications, the user presents an identity to the application as a set of\nclaims. One claim could be the user's name, another might be an email address. The\nexternal identity system is configured to give your application all the information that it\nneeds about the user with each request, along with cryptographic assurance that the\nidentity data received by the application comes from a trusted source.\n\nRationale:\n\nClaims-based identity allows you to factor out the authentication logic from individual\napplications. Instead of the application determining who the user is, it receives claims that\nidentify the user.\n\nIn software, this bundle of claims is called a security token. Each security token is signed by\nthe issuer who created it.
