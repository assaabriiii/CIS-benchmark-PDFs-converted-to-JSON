By limiting the number of failed log in attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing otherwise known as brute forcing is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.\n\nThe automatic password change feature for Managed Accounts allows SharePoint to automatically generate new strong passwords on a schedule set by the administrator.

        "info": "Separation of duties is a prevalent Information Technology control implemented at different layers of the information system including the operating system and in applications. It serves to eliminate or reduce the possibility that a single user may carry out a prohibited action. Separation of duties requires the person accountable for approving an action not be the same person tasked with implementing the action.\n\nThis requirement is intended to limit exposure due to users (or entities acting on behalf of users) being used to operate from within a privileged account or role. Limiting the access and permissions of privileged accounts to the minimum required, reduces exposure if the account is compromised and provides forensic history of activity when operating from these accounts.\n\nSee TechNet Article cc678863 for information regarding required permission. The setup user administrator account is used during initial creation of the farm, to update the farm servers, and to configure certain farm configuration option. The setup user administrator account must have membership in the local administrators Windows group on each server in the farm (excluding SQL Server and the Exchange server.)",
