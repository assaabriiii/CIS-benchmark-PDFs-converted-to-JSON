        "info": "Automated monitoring of remote access traffic allows organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by inspecting connection activities of remote access capabilities.\n\nRemote access methods include both unencrypted and encrypted traffic (e.g., web portals, web content filter, TLS, and webmail). With inbound TLS inspection, the traffic must be inspected prior to being allowed on the enclave's web servers hosting TLS or HTTPS applications. With outbound traffic inspection, traffic must be inspected prior to being forwarded to destinations outside of the enclave, such as external email traffic. This requirement does not mandate the decryption and inspection of SSL/TLS; it requires that if this is performed in the device, the decrypted traffic be inspected and conform to security policies.\n\nIf SSL/TLS traffic is decrypted in the device, it must be inspected.  The Palo Alto Networks security platform can be configured to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS connections going through the device.  With SSL Decryption, SSL-encrypted traffic is decrypted and App-ID and the Antivirus, Vulnerability, Anti-Spyware, URL Filtering, and File-Blocking Profiles can be applied to decrypted traffic before being re-encrypted and being forwarded.  This is not limited to SSL encrypted HTTP traffic (HTTPS); other protocols 'wrapped' in SSL/TLS can be decrypted and inspected.\n\nDecryption is policy-based and can be used to decrypt, inspect, and control both inbound and outbound SSL and SSH connections. Decryption policies allow the administrator to specify traffic for decryption according to destination, source, or URL category and in order to block or restrict the specified traffic according to security settings.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",

A botnet is a collection of software agents (referred to as 'bot'), residing on compromised computers.  Attacks are orchestrated by a 'bot herder' to command these agents to launch attacks. Part of the command and control communication between the controller and the bots is a message sent from a bot that informs the controller that it is operating.  This is referred to as a 'phone home' message.\n\nOn the Palo Alto Networks security platform, a security policy can include an Anti-spyware Profile for 'phone home' detection (detection of traffic from installed spyware).  The device has two pre-configured Anti-spyware Profiles; Default and Strict.  The Default Anti-spyware Profile sends an alert for detected phone-home traffic for all severity levels except the low and informational severity threat levels, while the Strict Anti-spyware Profile blocks phone-home traffic for the critical, high, and medium severity threat levels.\n\nPhone home traffic must either be blocked or intercepted by the DNS Sinkholing feature. Therefore, a custom Anti-spyware Profile or the Strict Anti-spyware Profile must be used instead of the Default Anti-spyware Profile.

This is a common practice in 'botnets', which are a collection of compromised computers using malware to attack (usually DDoS) other computers or networks. DDoS attacks frequently leverage IP source address spoofing, in which packets with false source IP addresses send traffic to multiple hosts, who then send return traffic to the hosts with the IP addresses that were forged. This can generate significant, even massive, amounts of traffic. Therefore, protection measures to counteract IP source address spoofing must be taken.\n\nEnclaves must enforce egress filtering. In egress filtering, packets leaving the enclave are discarded if the source IP address is not part of the IP address network(s), also known as prefixes, which are assigned to the enclave. A more specific form of egress filtering is to allow only those hosts and protocols that have been identified and authorized to exit the enclave. All traffic leaving the enclave, regardless of the destination, must be filtered by the premise router's egress filter to verify that the source IP address belongs to the enclave.\n\nConfigure a security policy that allows only traffic originating from the IP address prefixes assigned to the enclave to exit the enclave.

Installation of content filtering gateways and application-layer firewalls at key boundaries in the architecture mitigates the risk of DoS attacks. These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.\n\nDetection components that use rate-based behavior analysis can detect attacks when signatures for the attack do not exist or are not installed. These attacks include zero-day attacks that are new attacks for which vendors have not yet developed signatures. Rate-based behavior analysis can detect sophisticated, Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks by correlating traffic information from multiple network segments or components.\n\nPAN-OS can use either Zone-Based Protection or End Host Protection to mitigate DoS attacks. Zone-Based Protection protects against most common floods, reconnaissance attacks, and other packet-based attacks and is applied to any zone. End Host Protection is specific to defined end hosts. Zone Protections are always applied on the ingress interface, so if you wish to protect against floods or scans from the internet, you would  apply the profile on the zone containing the untrusted internet interface. Security administrators wishing to harden their networks even further can apply Zone Protections to both internal and external interfaces to ensure that protective measures are being applied across the entire environment.\n\nIt is important to set the Flood Protection parameters that are suitable for the enclave or system.

The audit storage on the Palo Alto Networks security platform is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the centralized log server designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred. However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real time, which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.
