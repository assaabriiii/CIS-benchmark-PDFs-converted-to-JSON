The specifics of how to achieve IP-to-username mapping is highly dependent on the environment. It can be enabled by integrating the firewall with a domain controller, Exchange server, captive portal, Terminal Server, User-ID Agent, XML API, or syslog data from a variety of devices.\nRationale:\nUnderstanding which user is involved in a security incident allows appropriate personnel to move quickly between the detection and reaction phases of incident response. In environments with either short DHCP lease times, or where users may move frequently between systems, the ability to analyze or report, or alert on events based on user accounts or user groups is a tremendous advantage.

Application-based rules, as opposed to service/port rules, further tighten what traffic is allowed to pass. Similarly, traffic from trusted to untrusted networks should have a security policy set, with application-based rules.
