In almost cases this means a trusted Public Certificate Authority, as in most cases remote access VPN users will not have access to any Private Certificate Authorities for Certificate validation.\n\nThe certificate should have a valid date. It should not have a 'to' date in the past (it should not be expired), and should not have a 'from' date in the future.\n\nThe key length used to encrypt the certificate should be 2048 bits or more.\n\nThe hash used to sign the certificate should be SHA-2 or better.\n\nWhen the Certificate is applied, the TLS version should be 1.1 or higher (1.2 is recommended)\n\nRationale:\n\nIf presented with a certificate error, the end user in most cases will not be able to tell if their session is using a self-signed or expired certificate, or if their session is being eavesdropped on or injected into by a 'Man in the Middle' attack. This means that self-signed or invalid certificates should never be used for VPN connections.\n\nImpact:\n\nNot using a trusted Certificate, issued by a trusted Public Certificate Authority means that clients establishing VPN sessions will always see an error indicating an untrusted Certificate.

For SSL Forward Proxy configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.\n\n1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. An MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or 'IoT' (Internet of Things) devices.\n\n2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as 'Visitors' in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of 'visitor' traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.\n\nRationale:\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's 'man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",

        "info": "The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. For SSL Forward Proxy configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.\n\n1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. An MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or 'IoT' (Internet of Things) devices.\n\n2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as 'Visitors' in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of 'visitor' traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.\n\nRationale:\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's 'man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
