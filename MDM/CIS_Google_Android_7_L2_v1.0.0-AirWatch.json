        "info": "Lock SIM card.\n\nRationale:\n\nIf your device uses a SIM card(s), enable SIM card lock. A SIM card PIN locks the SIM and prevents anyone from removing the SIM card from your device and use it on any other device without knowing the PIN. Also, you might choose to store your contacts and messages on the SIM card and thus it is highly recommended that you safeguard this valuable personal data by setting a custom PIN on the SIM card(s).\n\nNote: Only phones that are not locked by the service provider can lock the SIM card.",

        "description": "2.2 Ensure 'Location Services' is set to Disabled",
        "info": "Disable Location Services when not in use.\n\nRationale:\n\nLocation Services allows applications such as Maps and Internet websites to gather and use data indicating the user's location. The user's location is determined using available information from cellular network data, local Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth and GPS. If the user turns off Location Services, the user will be prompted to turn it back on again the next time any application tries to use this feature.\n\nDisabling location services reduces the capability of an attacker to determine or track the user's location via websites, locally installed applications or other means without user's consent. Thus, it should be disabled when not in use.\n\nNote: Location service is very important for tracking your lost device if the device data is not disabled. Make a judicious call and decide what works best for you or in your environment.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
        "solution": "Follow the below steps to disable Location Services:\n\n* Tap System Settings Gear Icon.\n* Scroll to Personal.\n* Tap Location.\n* Toggle it to Off position.\n\nImpact:\n\nEach time an application needs location data, the user activity would be interrupted to enable the location services.\n\nAnother impact could be on finding your lost device. If the device is lost and the location services are disabled, you cannot use remote locate services such as Android Device Manager.",

        "info": "Disable Backup to Google Drive.\n\nRationale:\n\nYou can back up content, data, and settings from your device to your Google Account. You can then later restore your backed-up information to another device. Due to privacy concerns, backing up personal data such as text messages, emails, photos and contacts to any third party is not recommended unless you accept the risk of sharing the data with the 3rd party. Moreover, if you are using a personal device for business apps such as emails, that data might be backed up as well in the Google Drive related to your personal account and might be exposed.
