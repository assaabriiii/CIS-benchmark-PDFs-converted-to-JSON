        "info": "Lock SIM card.\n        The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.\n\n        Rationale:\n\n        If your device uses a SIM card(s), enable SIM card lock. A SIM card PIN locks the SIM and prevents anyone from removing the SIM card from your device and use it on any other device without knowing the PIN. Also, you might choose to store your contacts and messages on the SIM card and thus it is highly recommended that you safeguard this valuable personal data by setting a custom PIN on the SIM card(s).\n        Note: Only phones that are not locked by the service provider can lock the SIM card.\n\n        NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
        "solution": "Follow the below steps to enable Lock SIM card:\n\n        Call up your SIM card provider and get the default SIM PIN.\n        Tap the Settings Gear Icon.\n        Tap Security.\n        Tap SIM card lock.\n        Toggle Lock SIM card to the on position.\n        Enter the default PIN provided by your SIM provider.\n        Press OK.\n        The Lock SIM card option will then be enabled.\n        Tap on Change SIM PIN.\n        Again provide the default PIN provided (Old PIN) by your SIM card provider.\n        Type your new custom PIN.\n        Re-type your new custom PIN.\n        Press OK.\n        Your custom SIM PIN is then set.\n        Repeat the process for your 2nd SIM, if applicable.\n\n        Impact:\n\n        You would need to remember your SIM card PIN. If you forget your SIM card PIN, you need your SIM card provider support for unlocking the SIM card.\n\n        Default Value:\n\n        By default, Lock SIM card is disabled. Also, the SIM card has a default PIN set by the provider which is usually universally known.",

        "info": "Disable Location when not in use.\n        The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.\n\n        Rationale:\n\n        Location allows applications such as Maps and Internet websites to gather and use data indicating the user's location. The user's location is determined using available information from cellular network data, local Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth and GPS. If the user turns off Location Services, the user will be prompted to turn it back on again the next time any application tries to use this feature.\n        Disabling location reduces the capability of an attacker to determine or track the user's location via websites, locally installed applications or other means without user's consent. Thus, it should be disabled when not in use.\n\n        Note: Location is very important for tracking your lost device if the device data is not disabled. Make a judicious call and decide what works best for you or in your environment.\n\n        NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",

If the device is lost and the location is disabled, you cannot use remote locate services such as Android Device Manager.\n\n        Default Value:\n\n        By default, Location is enabled.",

You can then later restore your backed-up information to another device. Due to privacy concerns, backing up personal data such as text messages, emails, photos and contacts to any third party is not recommended unless you accept the risk of sharing the data with the 3rd party. Moreover, if you are using a personal device for business apps such as emails, that data might be backed up as well in the Google Drive related to your personal account and might be exposed.
