They consist of the minimum password length and the required character types (numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and other kinds of characters). When you enable them, the system applies enforcement restrictions to all user accounts.\n - Policy restrictions represent the minimum and maximum lengths of time that passwords can be active. This type of policy restriction also includes values for the number of days prior to password expiration on which the system warns users and the number of previous passwords that the BIG-IP system stores to prevent users from reusing former passwords. When you configure policy restrictions using the Configuration utility, policy restrictions apply to all user accounts. These restrictions are always enabled, although the default values provide a minimal amount of restriction.\n   The secure password policy feature affects passwords for the BIG-IP system's local user accounts only.

        "info": "A virtual server with an associated HTTP profile processes connections using the BIG-IP system's full proxy architecture for the purpose of making requests on behalf of clients. In this mode, the BIG-IP system processes the three-way TCP handshake and initial data packet on the client-side connection before initiating the TCP handshake on the server-side connection; the client's data packet triggers the BIG-IP system to initiate the server-side connection.\n\n      NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
