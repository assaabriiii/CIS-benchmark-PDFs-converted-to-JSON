        "info": "Permit only the necessary IP addresses to be used to manage the device.\n\nRationale:\n\nManagement access to the device should be restricted to the IP addresses or subnets used by firewall administrators. Permitting management access from other IP addresses increases the risk of unauthorized access through password guessing, stolen credentials, or other means.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
