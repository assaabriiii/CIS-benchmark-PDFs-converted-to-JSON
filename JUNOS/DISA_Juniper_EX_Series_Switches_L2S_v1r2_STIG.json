Host interfaces and unknown DHCP servers are considered untrusted sources. An unknown DHCP server on the network on an untrusted interface is called a spurious DHCP server, any device (PC, Wireless Access Point) that is loaded with DHCP server enabled. The DHCP snooping feature determines whether traffic sources are trusted or untrusted. The potential exists for a spurious DHCP server to respond to DHCPDISCOVER messages before the real server has time to respond. DHCP snooping allows switches on the network to trust the interface a DHCP server is connected to and not trust the other interfaces.\n\nThe DHCP snooping feature validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages as well as rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources. The DHCP snooping feature builds and maintains a binding database, which contains information about untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses, and it utilizes the database to validate subsequent requests from untrusted hosts. Other security features, such as IP Source Guard and Dynamic Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Inspection (DAI), also use information stored in the DHCP snooping binding database.

For example, access interfaces can be marked as 'edge' for protocols like Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP) or Multiple Spanning Tree (MSTP) where specific protections can be applied to prevent the switch from accepting Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) from unauthorized sources and causing a network topology change or disruption. Additionally, network level protection mechanisms, like 802.1x or sticky-mac, are applied to access interfaces and these protection mechanisms help prevent unauthorized network access.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
