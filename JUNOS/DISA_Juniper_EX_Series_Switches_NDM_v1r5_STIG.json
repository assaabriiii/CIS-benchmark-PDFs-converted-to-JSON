        "info": "Successful identification and authentication must not automatically give an entity full access to a network device or security domain. The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset or set of resources. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nSome network devices are pre-configured with security groups. Other network devices enable operators to create custom security groups with custom permissions. For example, an ISSM may require read-only access to audit the network device. Operators may create an audit security group, define permissions and access levels for members of the group, and then assign the ISSM's user persona to the audit security group. This is still considered privileged access, but the ISSM's security group is more restrictive than the network administrator's security group.\n\nNetwork devices that rely on AAA brokers for authentication and authorization services may need to identify the available security groups or access levels available on the network devices and convey that information to the AAA operator. Once the AAA broker identifies the user persona on the centralized directory service, the user's security group memberships can be retrieved. The AAA operator may need to create a mapping that links target security groups from the directory service to the appropriate security groups or access levels on the network device. Once these mappings are configured, authorizations can happen dynamically, based on each user's directory service group membership.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",

When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nThis requirement addresses the configuration of network devices to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on device availability. For each network device, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.\n\nThe security safeguards cannot be defined at the DoD-level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (for example, firewalls performing packet filtering to block DoS attacks).\n\nNOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.",
