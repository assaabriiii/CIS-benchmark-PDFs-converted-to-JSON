Transport mode is used to create a secured session between two hosts. It can also be used when two hosts simply want to authenticate each IP packet with IPsec authentication header (AH). With ESP transport mode, only the payload (transport layer) is encrypted, whereas with tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted and encapsulated with a new IP header.
